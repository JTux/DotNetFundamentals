Komodo would like an app that allows a user to register for car
insurance. The app should be able to take in a name, age, and 
information about their vehicle. Komodo wants to charge them $75 
if they are over twenty-five and $125 if they are under. 

They also would like a menu that lets the user choose to register,
see their information, update their information, or exit the
program.
    
Bonus: Komodo would also like to increase the charge based on 
the car's mileage and whether or not they have had an accident.
If the car is over 50,000 miles add $25, if it is over 100,000 
miles add $50.
